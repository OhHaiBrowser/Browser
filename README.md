# Features

- **Your web menu** - Open tabs, your favorites and history only one click away, no longer hidden behind a scrollbar or menu option.
- **Smarter url bar** - Our URL bar will show you the true domain of a site just in case you do click anything fishy.
- **Minimal UI** - The simplest we could possible make the browser without causing more clicks. 



# Contributing
If you find any bugs or want to improve OhHai Browser please feel free to submit a pull request, [open an issue](https://github.com/OhHaiBrowser/Browser/issues/new) or send a homing pigeon. OhHai Browser is under constant development meaning bugs may happen from time to time (we're only human!). It would be great if you could point these our or even help us defeat them.

## Running

Before running OhHai Browser please make sure you have the **latest** [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

To run, open the repo in a terminal and run: 
```
npm install
```
Once this is done you can open the project in your editor of choice and run:
```
npm run debug
```
This should open the development version of the browser. 

Simples!
